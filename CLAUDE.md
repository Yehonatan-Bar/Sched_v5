## Project State Snapshot

Maintain a concise project state snapshot in the file: **`SNAPSHOT.md`**

### Rules

1. **Update at the end of each development session** - After completing any development work, update `SNAPSHOT.md` to reflect the current state.

2. **Current state only, not history** - The file should describe what exists NOW, not what changed or what was done. No changelog, no history, no timestamps of past work.

3. **Keep it concise** - Be brief and to the point. Use bullet points. No verbose explanations.

4. **Actively maintain conciseness** - When updating the snapshot, review the entire file. If content has become verbose or redundant, rephrase or consolidate to keep it tight. Don't just append - refactor the text as needed.

### SNAPSHOT.md Structure

```markdown
# Project Snapshot

## Overview
[1-2 sentence description of what this project does]

## Tech Stack
- [List technologies, frameworks, key dependencies]

## Project Structure
[Key directories and their purpose - only the important ones]

## Current Features
- [Working features in the current state]

## Known Issues
- [Any bugs or limitations that currently exist]

## Configuration
- [Key config files and environment requirements]

## How to Run
[Brief commands to start/test the project]
```

### What NOT to include in SNAPSHOT.md
- Development history or changelog
- Dates of when things were done
- Detailed implementation notes
- Future plans or roadmap
- Meeting notes or discussions

The snapshot answers: **"What is the current state of this project right now?"**
